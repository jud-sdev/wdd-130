   <p>Hello there, I'm Ebigide Jude, residing in the vibrant city of Lagos, Nigeria.. Currently, I'm on an exciting journey as an online student at BYU-Idaho, where I'm pursuing a degree in Software Development. Right now, I'm knee-deep in my first certificate program, which is web and computer programming.</p>
    <p>I came from a family of six, and I proudly hold the position of the fifth child. When I'm not immersed in coding and programming, you'll often find me with my nose in a book, catching up on the latest movies, or out on the field, playing football.</p>
    <p>I have a genuine passion for learning, and I thrive on connecting with people from all walks of life. So, if you ever want to chat about tech, literature, movies, or just about anything else, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always up for a friendly conversation!</p>
