    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this white water rafting site plan is to provide a comprehensive blueprint for the development, operation, and management of a white water rafting facility. This plan aims to ensure the safety, sustainability, and enjoyment of visitors while also supporting the economic and environmental objectives of the site. It serves as a guiding document for all stakeholders involved in the establishment and ongoing operation of the white water rafting site.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The primary audience will include adventure seekers, thrill enthusiasts, and individuals who enjoy outdoor activities and sports that involve an adrenaline rush. People who appreciate the natural beauty of river ecosystems and are drawn to outdoor experiences in scenic locations. Families looking for fun and safe outdoor adventures that can be enjoyed together. This includes parents with children of various ages. Corporate groups, school groups, sports teams, and other organized groups seeking team-building experiences or recreational outings. Both local and out-of-town tourists exploring the area and looking for unique and memorable experiences. Beginners who may have little or no prior experience in white water rafting but are interested in trying it out. Experienced rafters who are looking for challenging rapids and advanced courses.
    To make the white water rafting site inviting and appealing to this diverse audience, I'll consider the following design elements:
    I'll use vibrant and natural colors that evoke the outdoors, such as blues for water, greens for foliage, and earthy tones. These colors should create a sense of excitement and adventure while also highlighting the natural beauty of the surroundings. I'll choose legible and modern fonts that reflect the site's adventurous spirit and professionalism. Bold fonts for headings can convey excitement, while clean and readable fonts for body text ensure information is easily accessible. I'll also Incorporate high-quality images of rafters enjoying their experience, showcasing the thrill of white water rafting.</p>
